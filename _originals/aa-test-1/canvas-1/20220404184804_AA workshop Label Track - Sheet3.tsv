12.088814	19.487433	TR:We're speaking with Yaounde Olu. Hi Yaounde.
19.487433	20.081965	TR:Hi.
22.129797	28.47147	TR:Now. Once upon a time, there was a girl named Joyce Bowens, right?
28.47147	32.10472	TR:Joyce Bowen. B-o-w-e-n.
33.095606	37.719743	TR:And she was born somewhere at some time, presumably. When did that take place?
37.719743	43.334766	TR:Well, Joyce Patricia Bowen was born November 15, 1945.
43.665061	44.589889	TR:Where?
44.589889	46.241366	TR:In Chicago, Illinois.
46.637721	48.69381	TR:I see. And what did she do then?
50.048022	52.112368	TR:She began to observe the world around her.
52.971136	57.281492	TR:This is good. And I'm sure that she came up with some interesting observations.
58.338438	63.391959	TR:Yes, she did. She found life to be very strange and interesting.
66.348103	67.99958	TR:Mmhmm. Yes.
69.469395	80.327859	TR:And um... birth to me was like-- just a minute, do you want it to be this...? I mean, I'm, you know...
81.607754	82.507809	TR:Speak your mind.
82.895906	84.357464	TR:Wait, turn-- turn that off for a minute.
87.008085	110.888448	TR:My earliest experiences, in terms -- you know, with life, were very interesting. And they filled me with a desire to experience life in its fullest. You know, and gave me a positive attitude to try to do as best as I possibly could in life, in whatever it was that I wanted to do. I felt this very early in life.
113.225288	122.902945	TR:I see. And when did your artistic tendencies begin to really-- When did you become aware of your artistic tendencies?
123.563536	149.392642	TR:Well, my mother says that-- well, she has a drawing that I did when I was two years old. A recognizable baby buggy, she said it was really a baby buggy. And I think she still has it. But that was the first drawing I did. But I would like to say that I was influenced a great deal by my father too. My mother and my-- my parents are very interested in, you know, they like art.
149.392642	166.601036	TR:And my father was an artist. He wanted to be an artist, but he ended up with children, so he settled for doing other things, and sacrifices art. And that's why he has encouraged me to pursue art.
166.601036	185.460908	TR:He did murals of Popeye and Olive Oyl and people like that on my walls when I was a child, like two years old. So that was a great influence on me. You know, having art around me -- watching him, you know, actually paint and draw.
186.187558	187.839035	TR:And then I stick my hand in the water.
188.697804	198.738786	TR:Yes, well that's probably what it was there for. Anyway. So now, we have the two year old drawing the painting at two. Do you still have it?
199.432406	204.122602	TR:I think my mother has it. She keeps, she tells me about it but I haven't even looked at it.
204.205176	206.054831	TR:What media is it in? What does it look like?
225.988162	235.153862	TR:This is extremely interesting. But now could we move on and see, when did the next little artistic happening develop?
